# Animal Identification System

This Prolog program allows users to identify animals based on their characteristics. It presents a series of questions to the user and determines the animal based on their responses.


## How it works

The program defines facts about different animals and their characteristics, such as whether they have fur, feathers, or hooves, and the sounds they make. It then prompts the user with questions about these characteristics to narrow down the possible animals.
## Usage

To use the Animal Identification System, follow these steps:

1.Install Prolog: If you haven't already, install a Prolog interpreter on your system. You can find various Prolog implementations available for different platforms.

2.Run the Program: Execute the Prolog program containing the provided code. You can load the program into your Prolog interpreter and start the identification process.

3.Answer Questions: The program will prompt you with questions about the characteristics of an animal. Answer each question with "yes" or "no" to the best of your knowledge.

4.Identify the Animal: Based on your responses, the program will identify the most likely animal that matches the provided characteristics.

5.Repeat or Exit: After identifying an animal, the program will ask if you want to identify another animal. You can continue with additional identifications or exit the program.


## Supported Animals

The program currently supports the identification of the following animals:

Dog
Cat
Duck
Horse
Each animal has specific characteristics associated with it, such as fur, feathers, hooves, and sounds they make.
## Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the Animal Identification System:

```bash
 Welcome to the animal identification system!
Please answer the following questions to identify the animal.
Does the animal have fur? (yes/no): yes.
Does the animal say woof? (yes/no): yes.
The identified animal is: dog
Would you like to identify another animal? (yes/no): no.
Goodbye!

```
